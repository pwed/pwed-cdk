# bastion

A set of constructs to create and access bastion hosts using SSO or IAM. By using session manager for shell access and GUI Connect for Windows RDP access, no ports need to be exposed to the internet and all access can be managed and audited through AWS services.

## Todo

- Allow choco installs
- fix aws cli not installing with winget
- Allow picking and choosing of services in the access policy
